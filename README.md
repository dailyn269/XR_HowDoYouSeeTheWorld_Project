## Description:
Our project, undertaken by Dailyn Despradel in collaboration with Muzhe Wu and Zixin Yang, aimed to enhance understanding of visual impairments through immersive simulation. We designed an interactive learning experience to educate those with normal vision about the challenges faced by individuals with cataracts, glaucoma, and color blindness. Participants navigated through simulated environments—living room, kitchen, and basement—each designed to replicate the visual obstacles associated with these conditions. Tasks in these environments were carefully crafted based on research to offer a genuine experience of the difficulties encountered in daily life due to these impairments.

In the living room simulation, users experienced cataracts through various everyday tasks, including reading and using household devices. The kitchen environment simulated color blindness, challenging users with tasks like identifying ripe fruits and cooking while relying on color perception. The basement scenario replicated glaucoma's restricted vision through tasks requiring object counting and comparison. After these immersive experiences, participants engaged in a debriefing session, gaining deeper insights into the impairments, their causes, treatments, and impacts. Postprocessing techniques, including depth of field adjustments and color grading, were employed to accurately simulate the visual conditions, enhancing the educational value and fostering empathy and inclusivity among participants.
